# KNIME-Analytics

## About the Tool
KNIME Analytics Platform is an open-source powerhouse for data-driven innovation, enabling the discovery of hidden potential in data, fresh insights, and predictive foresight. Its standout feature is the no-code, drag-and-drop interface for building complex data workflows, which garners high praise from both analysts and data scientists.

## Why It Intrigued Me
For a newcomer to data science, KNIME offers an accessible gateway thanks to its intuitive graphical interface. It allows the performance of sophisticated statistical and data manipulations without writing code. The tool is notable for its comprehensive suite of machine learning algorithms and data processing modules, comparable to visualization tools like Tableau, with the additional benefit of advanced analytics capabilities.

## How I Utilized This Tool
In this mini-project, I harnessed the power of KNIME using synthetic datasets for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. I created a line plot that presents trends in IT helpdesk ticket resolution, differentiated by severity levels, which spotlights the mean resolution time and maximum days each ticket was open. This visualization offers a quick interpretation of service performance and identifies areas that may need improvement.

## Learnings
KNIME significantly minimized manual effort, a boon for data scientists who value rapid iteration. This project provided me with a practical understanding of KNIME’s functionalities and an appreciation for visual programming in enhancing the data science workflow.

## Key Insights Gained from the Output Visual
1. The average resolution time for IT helpdesk tickets is significantly higher for critical issues compared to minor ones, indicating a need for a more efficient problem-solving approach for critical cases.
2. There is a noticeable spike in the maximum number of days tickets remain open when it comes to 'Normal' severity level tickets. This could suggest either a misclassification of severity or a bottleneck in the resolution process for this category.
3. Despite the 'Critical' severity level having a high mean resolution time, these tickets do not stay open as long as some 'Minor' or 'Normal'

## Seeking Suggestions and Feedback
I welcome your suggestions or feedback on this mini-project and the KNIME workflow. Whether it’s technical advice, analytical insights, or ways to improve the interpretability of visual outcomes, your input is crucial for refining the analytics process.
